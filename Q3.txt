What is the difference between composition and inheritance in Java and OOP?

Answer:

 Inheritance is a mechanism where one class inherits properties and behaviors  from another class,
forming an "is-a" relationship. For example, if I have a Dog class that extends an Animal class, Dog is a type of Animal, and it can access all public and protected methods of the Animal.(its like how i am related to my father, i inherit his genes.)
Composition involves building a class using instances of other classes, forming a "has-a" relationship. 
For instance a Car class might have an Engine object as one of its fields, meaning a Car "has an" Engine.
Inheritance is used for reusing code, while composition is used to build complex objects using simpler ones.
Inheritance creates a hierarchy, while composition creates a more flexible, modular design.
